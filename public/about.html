<h1>About Netuno</h1>
<p>Netuno is a lovely little cat that was born on the 21st of September of 2015.
  I adopted him from a shelter, and the story is a bit funny.
</p>

<p>I've found the Facebook page for the shelter, and as soon as I saw his picture there
  on the adoption page, I knew I had found my cat.<br />
  I can't explain it, but my heart told me I should bring him home because that was my baby. Not one to disregard a feeling like
  that,<br />
  I decided to contact the person responsible for the shelter and scheduled a visit.
</p>

<p>
  Now here comes the funny part. When I got to the shelter, he was all alone, hiding from the
  other cats and humans alike. Of course,<br/>
  he was very skeptical of me at first and kept hiding 
  away. The woman from the shelter then told me that maybe I should pick another<br />
  cat; she told me that if I were looking for an affectionate, "lap cat", he wasn't the one. She insisted
  he was the cold type and didn't like<br />
  people, but I didn't care. I wanted to bring him home, so 
  I did.
</p>

<p>
  And that was the best decision I've ever made. My baby Netuno couldn't be sweeter or more 
  affectionate! He loves cuddling, and he loves<br />
  being around me; he follows me all day, everywhere!
  When I'm working, he lies down next to my laptop and sleeps. If I get up to get a snack,<br />
  he gets up and goes with me to the kitchen. If I go to the bathroom and close the door with him still outside,
  he meows and demands that I let him<br />
  in. He dislikes being away from me just as much as I dislike being away from him.
</p>

<p>
  I'm so glad that I've found him, or that he found me, maybe. There's nothing else in this world that
  I could ever love more than I love him. <br/>
  (and his siblings, of course)
