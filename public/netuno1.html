<h1>The Best Cat In The World</h1>
<h2>Reasons Why My Cat Is The Best.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>He is very affectionate</h3>
<p>My baby boy loves cuddling, and whenever he's next to me (and awake) he demands to be petted. If I stop, he'll tap me with his cute little paw until I start again.</p>
<h3>He hates everyone but me</h3>
<p>Very loyal, yep. I'm the only one he'll sleep with, and the only one he allows to do things such as:
 <ul>
    <li>Give him medicine</li>
    <li>Give him a bath</li>
    <li>Brush his fur or cut his nails</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<h3>He is super cute</h3>
<p>This one speaks for itself. He's already cute just for being a cat, but being him, he's super cute. </p>
